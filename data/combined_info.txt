# **TechGropse – Company Overview, FAQs & Privacy Policy (Combined Document)**

## **1. Mobile App Development FAQs**

### **What is the difference between native and cross-platform app development?**

**Native applications** are built for a single platform using languages such as Swift (iOS) or Kotlin (Android). These applications deliver high performance, full access to device features, and a superior user experience.

**Cross-platform applications** are built using frameworks such as Flutter or React Native, enabling deployment on multiple platforms with one codebase. This approach reduces development time and cost, with minor performance limitations and restricted access to some native capabilities.

### **How much does it cost to develop a mobile app?**

Cost varies based on complexity:

* **Simple application:** $10,000 – $50,000
* **Medium complexity:** $50,000 – $150,000
* **Complex application:** $200,000+

Key cost determinants include feature set, number of platforms, UI/UX complexity, backend requirements, integrations, and maintenance expectations.

---

### **How long does it take to develop a mobile app?**

Timeframe depends on project scope:

* **Simple:** 2–3 months
